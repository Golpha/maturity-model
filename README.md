Adopting open source software is not a single act, but a series of steps, varying in complexity, that require unique knowledge and processes at each step. For example, downloading a web browser based on open source software, like Google Chrome, is the simplest step in adopting open source. Releasing your own open source code and managing an ongoing project is harder. Shipping a product like GitHub Enterprise that is built on hundreds of open source projects is one of the most complex.

## A maturity model for open source adoption

A [maturity model](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MaturityModel.html) is a tool to assess the effectiveness of behaviors, practices and processes in producing the desired outcomes. The model defines a set of structured levels that lead an organization down a path of more systematically organized and mature processes.

A maturity model for adopting open source software will guide an organization through steps of increasing complexity in adopting open source. Those steps fall into one of four categories:

1. Using open source software.
2. Contributing back to the open source projects you use.
3. Releasing your own software as open source.
4. Embracing open source as a strategy for producing better software.

Organization will have different questions and face unique challenges as they embrace more mature processes. Below are some of the questions that various people in an organization ask when for each type of activity.

### Using open source software.

- What are the benefits of using open source software?
- What are the risks of using open source software?
- How do I find projects?
- How do I evaluate the quality and health of an open source project?
- What are the basics of open source licensing?
- What are some strategies for managing dependencies?

### Contributing back to the projects you use.

- How do I convince my boss to let me contribute to open source software?
- How do I GitHub?
- What are the IP concerns?

### Releasing your own software as open source.

- How do I get my source code ready for release?
- How do I choose a license?
- What else do I need to know about IP?
- How do I build a community?
- How do I implement and enforce a Code of Conduct?

### Embracing open source as a strategy for producing better software.

- How can our organization work like an open source project internally?
- How do I establish an open source policy?
- How can our open source involvement help us with hiring?

## Potential applications of the Maturity Model

The maturity model is being developed with two primary goals in mind:

- Evaluating how our products, programs, services, and resources are helping customers develop more mature practices around open source.

- Creating a comprehensive _starter kit_ or [_field manual_](https://github.com/github/open-source/issues/94) that includes all the resources needed to use, contribute to, release, and manage open source projects on GitHub.

## Current Status

The maturity model is currently a very early concept and actively being developed.
