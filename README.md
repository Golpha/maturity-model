Adopting open source software is not a single act, but a series of steps, varying in complexity, that require unique knowledge and processes at each step. For example, downloading a web browser based on open source software, like Google Chrome, is the simplest step in adopting open source. Releasing your own open source code and managing an ongoing project is harder. Shipping a product like GitHub Enterprise that is built on hundreds of open source projects is one of the most complex.

## A maturity model for open source adoption

A [maturity model](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MaturityModel.html) is a tool to assess the effectiveness of behaviors, practices and processes in producing the desired outcomes. The model defines a set of structured levels that lead an organization down a path of more systematically organized and mature processes.

A maturity model for adopting open source software will guide an organization through steps of increasing complexity in four adopting open source:

1. Using open source software.
2. Contributing back to the open source projects you use.
3. Releasing your own software as open source.
4. Embracing open source as a strategy for producing better software.

At each of these levels, an organization will have different questions and face unique challenges. Below are some of the questions that various people in an organization ask when they are at each level.

### Using open source software.

- What are the benefits of using open source software?
- What are the risks of using open source software?
- How do I find projects?
- How do I evaluate the quality and health of an open source project?
- What are the basics of open source licensing?
- What are some strategies for managing dependencies?

### Contributing back to the projects you use.

- How do I convince my boss to let me contribute to open source software?
- How do I GitHub?
- What are the IP concerns?

### Releasing your own software as open source.

- How do I get my source code ready for release?
- How do I choose a license?
- What else do I need to know about IP?
- How do I build a community?
- How do I implement and enforce a Code of Conduct?

### Embracing open source as a strategy for producing better software.

- How can our organization work like an open source project internally?
- How do I establish an open source policy?
- How can our open source involvement help us with hiring?

## Ok, Now what?

I suspect that this framework could be helpful for many aspects of what we do as a company, such as the structure of our help docs, our training offerings, github.com features, other products offerings, or other programs that we establish.

- After a very quick and informal glance at our [current docs](https://gist.github.com/bkeepers/0b7fbbb19a7ec4b4c9f7), most of them focus on level 2 and 3.

- Our fantastic [Patchwork](https://github.com/github/patchwork) program helps people learn how to fork and contribute back to open source projects, which fits squarely in level 2 of this maturity model. Is there an opportunity for similar programs focused on level 1 and level 3?

- choosealicense.com is mostly targeting people at level 3 that are releasing their open source projects. What resources do we have to offer consumers of open source at level 1, or folks with IP concerns at level 2?

One result of this model could be a complete _starter kit_ or [_field manual_](https://github.com/github/open-source/issues/94) that includes all the resources needed to use, contribute to, release, and manage open source projects on GitHub.

- What other questions or challenges to organizations face at each level of this maturity model?
- Do an audit our documentation, resources, programs, and features and think about where they fit in this maturity model

## Current Status

The maturity model is currently a very early concept and actively being developed.
