# Consuming

{TODO: intro}

## Goals

An organization consuming open source software aims to improve:

- [Productivity](/goals/productivity.md)
- [Efficiency](/goals/efficiency.md)
- [Quality](/goals/quality.md)
- [Flexibility](/goals/flexibility.md)
- [Longevity](/goals/longevity.md)
- [Security](/goals/security.md)

- reduce dependency on vendors
- reduce TCO
- develop new lines of business
- Ease onboarding
- Easier adoption and support of new technologies

- Collaboration with developer community

## Challenges

- Complexity of integrating with existing systems
- Availability of skills to manage the software
- Quality
- Security
- Support
- Time to implementation
- License compliance

## Processes

- Education & Training on benefits, challenges, and risks
  - learning how to interact with the community to ask questions/get help
- Acquisition - evaluating fitness, health, security, and provenance
- CVE tracking
- Keeping up to date with recent stable releases
- license compliance
- Bill of materials
- defining open source policy

## Measure

- how long does it take for evaluation & approval
- defect rate
- churn for open source projects
- tracking ongoing health of the projects / communities you depend on
- How well is open source helping us achieve our goals?
- performance of the open source projects themselves
- heuristics for when to write your own (implement vs acquire)

## Level 1: Ad-Hoc

I guarantee you every company in the world has had open source software introduced somewhere in their technology stack. Even if it's as simple as someone getting stuck on a problem, Googling for a solution, and copying/pasting code from a website like stack overflow.

- ad-hoc process, communication
- success depends on **heroics**
- outcomes are unpredictable
- no automation, everything is manual

- relies on existing knowledge & experience of developer
- No consideration to strategy
- No process for evaluating suitability, security, health, legal concerns, total cost of ownership, etc
- No process for updating, maintaining

but heroics prove successful

## Level 2: Managed

I think they call this a "pilot program".

- success depends on **discipline**
- begin conversations
- roles & responsibilities defined (devs, legal, security, etc)
- basic processes established, but not standardized across org
- some docs & tooling, some automated tasks, but not processes

## Level 3: Defined

- processes are defined, documented, standardized, and integrated into each other
- automated infrastructure to support processes
- projects use same framework, but modify standard processes to fit needs
- shared accountability
- success depends on **automation**

## Level 4: Measured

- business insights
- quality and performance/effectiveness measured
- statistically/quantitatively understood & controlled
- completely automated & controlled processes
- insight into all activities & relationship between them (status, cost, time to complete, etc)
- metrics measured against business goals
- success depends on **metrics**

collect metrics that can help achieve predictable expectations

- Organizational Process Performance
  - how long does it take for evaluation & approval
  - defect rate
  - churn for open source projects
  - tracking ongoing health of the projects / communities you depend on
  - How well is open source helping us achieve our goals?
- Quantitative Project Management
  - performance of the open source projects themselves
  - heuristics for when to write your own (implement vs acquire)

## Level 5: Optimizing

- use measurements to pilot new ideas and technologies
- continuous assessment of overall processes
- optimizing to achieve business objectives
- changes implemented with reduced risk/cost
- continuous improvement of automated processes
- continuous knowledge sharing / individual empowerment
- remove manual review processes?
- success depends on **continuous improvement**
